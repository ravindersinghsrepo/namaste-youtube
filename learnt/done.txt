episode 1 
built the UI 
Built the functionality of collapsing the sidebar 
-> redux store build for creating a global level store of state 
for toggle functionality only 
also used live apis for rendering the home page data and the watchpage data . 
on watch page we showed embeded iframe only 
ALso added routes for home page by clicking the home in the sidebar and watchpage 

episode 2

for implementing the search functionality  : 

debouncing concept 

key-i
render the component
useEffect called ; 
start timer attached to a callback function which makes an api call after 200ms

key-ip
destroys the component(useffect return method); 
 - > cleanup method is called everytime the function is re rendered. (provided we made useffect call in previous render cycle); 
 -> in the cleanup method we called a clearTimeout method .  
 this clearTimeout method executes if user types somthing before 200ms time. & therefore api call is declined 
re-render the component
useEffect called 
start timer => makes api call after 200ms

also implemented comments page in the watch page and these comments are nested comments 

IMPORTANT to learn deep about the behaviour of eseEffect and redux toolkit
setInterval clearinterval setTImeout and clearTimeout

splice method
